This repository contains my set of Calibre recipes.

Calibre is a free program to manage ebooks on your hard drive and on your
ebook device (in my case Sony PRS-300).

I use recipes gathered here to save web content I want to read as *.lrf ebook
format for my device. However the recipes can be used to convert to various
formats supported by Calibre (epub, lrf, txt, pdf etc.).
